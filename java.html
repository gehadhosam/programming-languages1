<p> The Java programming language was developed by Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Although it is primarily used for Internet-based applications, Java is a simple, efficient, general-purpose language. Java was originally designed for embedded network applications running on multiple platforms. It is a portable, object-oriented, interpreted language.

    Java is extremely portable. The same Java application will run identically on any computer, regardless of hardware features or operating system, as long as it has a Java interpreter. Besides portability, another of Java's key advantages is its set of security features which protect a PC running a Java program not only from problems caused by erroneous code but also from malicious programs (such as viruses). You can safely run a Java applet downloaded from the Internet, because Java's security features prevent these types of applets from accessing a PC's hard drive or network connections. An applet is typically a small Java program that is embedded within an HTML page.

    Java programs are more highly structured than C++ equivalents. All functions (or Java methods) and executable statements in Java must reside within a class while C++ allows function definitions and lines of code to exist outside of classes (as in C-style programs). Global data and methods cannot reside outside of a class in Java, whereas C++ allows this. These restrictions, though cumbersome at times, help maintain the integrity and security of Java programs and forces them to be totally object-oriented.


<h1>why java is important </h1>
Java is used to build applications and platforms for a number of devices, including computers, laptops, gaming consoles, Blu-ray players, car navigation systems, medical monitoring devices, parking meters, lottery terminals and smartphones. It is also a key language for networking, particularly for data centers that store and transfer Web-based data.
